three links.The first is the home link,that directs the user to the login page, the second is the
feedback link, that directs the user to a feedback page and the third is an about link that directs the user to a page showing what the application is about. In the login page, you can fill the login form and submit it so that you can be directed to the main page. If you are a new user, you can press the sign up button which will direct you to a sign up form that you can fill and submit then be directed to the main page.In the main page is a location form asking the user to input a location.When the user has filled the form and submitted it, the page will display the temperature,wind speed,weather description and weather icon of the specified location.To receive a recommendation on what to wear or carry, the user will press the recommendation button that will display a recommendation with regards to the weather details given. If the user is satisfied with the application, they can press the feedback link on the navigation menu which will direct them to a feedback page that has a like button.When the like button is pressed, the colour of the heart and text in the button should change from black to blue.There is also a text area where the user can write a comment on the weather application.When the user submits the comment, they will receive an alert saying that their feedback has been received and is highly appreciated. When the user clicks on the about link on the navigation menu, they will be taken to a page that contains the details of the applications purpose.That's all about the application.
